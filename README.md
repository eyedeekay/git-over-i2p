git-over-i2p
============

TUTORIAL for setting up git access through an I2P Tunnel. This tunnel will act
as your access point to a single git service on I2P.

This **NOT** git-remote-i2p, I'm working on it, it'll be ready soon.
git-remote-i2p will automatically tunnel to a git service hosted at an I2P
domain or at a .b32.i2p address.

... for a simple docker+Gitlab CE over I2P setup

[If you're trying to set up a git *client* for any reason, go here](GIT.md)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

... for a tunnel-based configuration to access any Git service.
